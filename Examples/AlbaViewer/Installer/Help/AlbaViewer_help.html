basics: software framework</font> 
</h1>
<p align="justify">To allow the user to interact with and visualise
data, we embedded the core algorithm of AlbaViewer in a software
framework based on the Visualisation Toolkit (www.vtk.org) and other
specialised libraries. Within this framework, the main entities
exposed to users are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Data objects,
	called also Virtual Medical Entities, VMEs for short in the
	following; 
	</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Views, that
	provide interactive visualisation of the VMEs; 
	</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Operations, that
	create new VMEs or modify existing ones (special Operations are the
	Importers, that let you import and convert into a VME almost any
	biomedical dataset, and the Exporters that can convert the VME into
	files formatted according to common standards); 
	</p>
	<li><p align="justify">Graphical User Interface (GUI) components; 
	</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Each session of AlbaViewer , including data, can
be saved and reloaded. When saving, object properties and
relationships among objects are stored in an XML file with extension
.bmt . This .bmt file links to a complementary folder, in which the
datasets relative to each object are stored in binary format. 
</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h2 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">VMEs </font>
</h2>
<p align="justify">VMEs provide the data representation. A VME
represents a data entity. There are many VME types, that can be used
to represent almost any biomedical image or signal. VMEs are
organized in a hierarchical tree (VME Tree or data Tree) and they are
all composed by a dataset, a matrix that defines the pose of the VME
with respect to its parent in the VME Tree, and a set of metadata
that provides all the attributes of the VME. 
</p>
<h3 class="western" align="justify">Root 
</h3>
<p align="justify"><img src="Figures/VME/albaVMERoot.png" name="Immagine1" alt="figure Figures/VME/albaVMERoot.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="15" border="0"/>

Root is the base VME of the datatree. This vme is used as entry point
for the creation of all other VMEs. This VME cannot be created by the
user but is created when AlbaViewer is launched or a new .bmt is
created (<i>Path: File &#8197;&rarr;&#8197; New</i>) 
</p>
<h3 class="western" align="justify">Group 
</h3>
<p align="justify"><img src="Figures/VME/albaVMEGroup.png" name="Immagine2" alt="figure Figures/VME/albaVMEGroup.png" align="bottom" width="15" height="14" border="0"/>

Group is a VME used for grouping and tree management propouse. You
can create this VME in the tree contextual menu. The name of the
group can be changed in the VME tab. 
</p>
<h3 class="western" align="justify">Volume Gray 
</h3>
<p align="justify"><img src="Figures/VME/albaVMEVolumeGray.png" name="Immagine3" alt="figure Figures/VME/albaVMEVolumeGray.png" align="bottom" width="17" height="18" border="0"/>

Volume is a VME that contains a volumetric 3d dataset tipically
obtained from a CT or MRI acquisition. The data contained in this
dataset is stored in a regular grid of voxels. This VME can contains
two type of data: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Structured Points:
	this is a topological and geometrical regular array of points. In
	this case all voxels have the same size. 
	</p>
	<li><p align="justify">Rectilinear Grid: represents a geometric
	structure that is topologically regular with variable spacing in the
	three coordinate directions x-y-z. In this case the size of voxels
	is not constant. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" align="justify"><a name="toc-Subsubsection-5.1.4"></a>

</h3>
<p align="justify"><img src="Figures/VME/albaVMEMesh.png" name="Immagine4" alt="figure Figures/VME/albaVMEMesh.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="18" border="0"/>

albaVMEMesh is a VME that contains an unstructured grid data. This
VME contains volumetric objects. Three-dimensional meshes are created
for finite element analysis (FEM) and consist of tetrahedra,
pyramids, prisms, hexahedra or wedge. 
</p>
<h2 class="western" align="justify">Views 
</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Views allow data
examination. There are various views that permit to examine the VMEs.
A View provides an interactive representation of the VME Tree. For
each view the system maintains a display list of the VMEs that are
currently rendered in that view. The Views available in AlbaViewer
are: Orthoslice and Surface.</p>
