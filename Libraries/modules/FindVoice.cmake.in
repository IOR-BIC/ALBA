# Module:    $RCSfile: FindVoice.cmake.in,v $
# Language:  CMake 1.2
# Date:      $Date: 2004-08-25 13:44:27 $
# Version:   $Revision: 1.1 $

# Description:
# This module finds the location of the Voice include and library paths 
# It works if included from within the MFL build tree or if FindMFL is called before this one
#
# This module defines
#
# VOICE_SOURCE_PATH - where is the source tree (only defined if sources are provided)
# VOICE_BINARY_PATH - where is the binary tree (only defined if sources are provided)
# USE_PRECOMPILED_VOICE - true if a precompiled version of the binaries is provided
