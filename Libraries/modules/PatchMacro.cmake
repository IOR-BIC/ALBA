Resolution of this problem is as follows. First, close CMAKE and then delete both Sources and Build subdirectories of package ${PACKAGE_NAME} from the directory where to build the binaries (or preferably the whole directory). After that execute CMAKE, this time as administrator (use the right click on the CMAKE shortcut) - please do not mistake this for running CMAKE under a user account with administration rights, and repeat the process. Should the problem persists, contact ALBA developer group.\n")
