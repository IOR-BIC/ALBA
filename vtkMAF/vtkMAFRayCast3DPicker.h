/** class for 3D geometric pickers (uses ray cast)
  vtkPicker is used to select instances of vtkProp3D by shooting a ray 
  into a graphics window and intersecting with the actor's bounding box. 
  The ray is defined from couple of points in world coordinates, 
  and a point located from the camera's position.
 
  vtkPicker may return more than one vtkProp3D, since more than one bounding 
  box may be intersected. vtkPicker returns the list of props that were hit, 
  the pick coordinates in world and untransformed mapper space, and the 
  prop (vtkProp3D) and mapper that are "closest" to the camera. The closest 
  prop is the one whose center point (i.e., center of bounding box) 
  projected on the ray is closest to the camera.

  Inspired to vtkCellPicker.

  @todo
  - rewrite all documentation!!!
