/// vtkMAFPolyDataNavigator. \n
/// Useful methods for navigating and editing vtkPolyData and vtkIdList. \n\n
///
/// Methods already provided by vtkPolyData are: \n
/// GetCellPoints(cellid, idlist) to get the points on a cell \n
/// GetPointCells(ptid, idlist) to get the cells around a point \n
/// GetCellEdgeNeighbours(cellId, id0, id1, idlist) to get the cell neighbours across a cell edge. \n\n
///
/// Formats of lists: \n
/// Edges are listed as EdgeVector = std::vector<Edge>, \n
/// and Id's of points and cells as vtkIdList. \n
/// However we also use std::multimap and std::set if efficiency demands.
//
// For Developers:
//
// polydata->GetCellPoints() is much faster than polydata->GetCell()->GetCellIds(),
// which has only serial access to the cells.
//
// Methods which use GetCellPoints() need BuildCells().
// Methods which use GetPointCells() need BuildLinks().
// All the point, edge and cell methods depend on at least one of these.
// GetCellPoints() and GetPointCells() will build the links themselves if they are not already built,
// but will NOT update existing links if they are invalid, causing a crash.
// Therefore methods which change the polydata should finish by deleting the invalid links,
// or carry a warning that the user should do it.
