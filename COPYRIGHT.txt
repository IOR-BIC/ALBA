The BSD 3-Clause License
[OSI Approved License]
The BSD 3-Clause License

    The following is a BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") license template. To generate 
	your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values 
	as given here, and substitute your own.

    Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its colloquial name "BSD New",
	this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it was followed by the even newer 
	BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the "Simplified BSD License". On January 9th, 2008 the 
	OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final 
	"no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.

    Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses. The advertising 
	clause (the third of four clauses) required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in 
	your advertising of any product using that code. It was officially rescinded by the Director 
	of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He 
	states that clause 3 is "hereby deleted in its entirety." The four clause license has not been 
	approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the advertising clause.

    This prelude is not part of the license.

<OWNER> = Regents of the University of California
<ORGANIZATION> = University of California, Berkeley
<YEAR> = 1998

In the original BSD license, the occurrence of "copyright holder" in the 3rd clause read 
"ORGANIZATION", placeholder for "University of California". In the original BSD license, 
both occurrences of the phrase "COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read 
"REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS".

Here is the license template:
