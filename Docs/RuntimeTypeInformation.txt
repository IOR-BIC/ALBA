[HOWTO about ALBA custom RTTI Apis]

The new ALBA tree now has its own API for RTTI. These rtti Apis are implementated
over standard C++ RTTI mechanims, and in most part the two syntax are equivalent. 
ALBA systax are inspired to VTK and ITK syntax for the same kind of objects. See 
the Doxygen pages fr more
details on syntax.
The idea behaind these Apis is to provide simple functions to query an object
about its type. Apis allow either alphanumerical queries (these are not available
in standard C++ rtti apis), and by a "typeid". The later is much faster, while the 
former provide features usually avaliable only in scripting languages.

*** STATIC type versus object TYPE. 
All Apis are subdivided into two groups: static apis and non-static ones. The 
first ones allow to query the a pointer variable for its type. The returned
type is not related to the pointed object but to the pointer itself. E.g.
GetStaticName() returns the type of the pointer. On the other hand non static
functions query the pointed object. Following example shows the difference:

albaObject *ptr = new albaEvent;
albaString static_name = ptr->GetStaticTypeName();
albaString real_name = ptr->GetTypeName();

static_name is "albaObject", while real_name is "albaEvent".

*** RTTI Macro and Abstract VS Concrete classes
Any class inheriting from albaObject must add one of the two following lines
to its declaration (in the public: area):

  albaTypeMacro(classname,parent_classname);

or

 albaAbstractTypeMacro(classname,parent_classname);

where "classname" is the name of the class, and "parent_classname" is the name
of the main parent class. Note in ALBA multiple inheritance is supported but
with limitations, and hierarchical RTTI only refers to main parent class. See
also (ALBA interfaces HowTo)

The first macro must be used by concrete classes, i.e. that do not have pure 
virtual member functions and thus can be created. Classes representing only
interfaces (abstract classes) must use the second macro. The difference is
the first also defines methods to instantiate the class (see the ObjectFactory
HowTo).

Also, all classes inheriting from albaObjectFactory must add one of the following 
two lines to the .cpp file:

albaCxxTypeMacro(classname)

or

albaCxxAbstractTypeMacro(classname)

*** Superclass typedef
Type macros also define the "Superclass" type, which concide with the parent
class type. This should preferably be used to refer to the parent class, since
in case of changing the parent class the code needs less patching.
