/** albaMTime - record modification timestamp.
  albaMTime records a unique time stamp when the method Modified() is 
  called. This time is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
  If ALBA is build with VTK compilation enabled (ALBA_USE_VTK) this object
  uses a vtkTimeStamp as counter to have a unique time stamp against the
  two libraries.   
@todo
 - fix the InterlockedIncrement - which was temporary commented out (sil)
