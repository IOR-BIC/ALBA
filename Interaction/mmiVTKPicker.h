class vtkCellPicker;

/** 
class name: mmiVTKPicker
Implements mouse move of camera in the scene or perform continuous
cell picking when using CTRL modifier.

If CTRL modifier is pressed a pick is performed, which according to the
current context leads to various events sent to the listener

1) CRTL + left mouse button down
If any VTK object is picked using vtkCellPicker, then VME_PICKING event is 
issued with the following parameters:
Bool = false
VtkObj = reference to vtkCellPicker that performed the picking

2) left mouse button up
If any VTK object was picked during CTRL + left mouse down, then 
VME_PICKED event is issued with parameters:
VtkObj = reference to original vtkCellPicker

3) mouse move
If ContinuousPicking is enabled (by default it is disabled) and
any VTK object was picked during CTRL + left mouse down, 
then VME_PICKING event is issued with the following parameters:
Bool = true
VtkObj = reference to vtkPoints containing the new position of
point picked during CTRL + left mouse down
